# Getting started with Shiny [Video]
This is the code repository for [Getting started with Shiny [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-started-shiny-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124028), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Shiny is a user contributed package for R that allows interactive web interfaces to easily be delivered through a web browser using only R code. No JavaScript is required. It’s simple to use R code to build user interfaces. There is also a lot of power and flexibility within the Shiny package, and its functionality can be expanded using user-contributed packages, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In this video course, you’ll start off by installing R, R Studio, and Shiny. Moving on, you’ll learn about Code files and how to build a simple application in Shiny. You’ll explore an RMarkdown document to understand how Shiny can be embedded straight into a document. 

Moving on, you’ll learn about the Shiny input and output widgets and how to put them together into a larger application. Further we’ll present several features of Shiny, such as animation, data tables, downloading and uploading data, and how to produce attractive and interactive data tables. We’ll also include a toy example.

Finally, you will learn about reactive programming in Shiny and how to control reactivity in your programs. We’ll use a full-featured application to explore the ggplot2movies dataset. Moving on we’ll show you in detail how reactivity works, how it can be controlled. We’ll conclude the course by learning how to handle errors, debugging, and rate control in Shiny applications.
